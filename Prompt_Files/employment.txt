Equal Employment Opportunity
Equal Opportunity is the expressed policy of SmithCo. Our policy is to select the best-qualified person for each position in the organization and to conduct all business relationships without prejudice. SmithCo is committed to the principles of equal employment opportunity for all employees and applicants for employment. Advancement opportunities and employment decisions will be made without regard to race, creed, color, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, age, physical or mental handicap, veteran or military status, or any other characteristic protected under federal, state, or local law.

Managers are expected to seek out a diverse pool of candidates for consideration when making hiring decisions. SmithCo also develops an annual Affirmative Action program, which is a federal requirement due to our status as a government contractor. The leadership team plays an active role in demonstrating SmithCo’s commitment by providing equal employment opportunities at all levels of employment. Managers and employees are advised to meet with the HR manager for assistance in meeting the standards set in this policy.

Equal Employment Opportunity Applies Throughout The Employment Process
To advance the principles of equal employment opportunity, SmithCo also extends this policy to every phase of the employment process including, but not limited to, recruitment, selection, placement, transfer, training and development, promotion, compensation, benefits, layoffs, termination, and all other conditions or benefits of employment. All employees are expected to abide by and promote this policy of equal employment opportunity within the organization, as well as with those who have a business relationship with SmithCo.

Equal Employment Opportunity Requires the Participation of All Associates
While overall authority for implementing an Equal Employment Opportunity policy is assigned to the Vice President of Human Resources, an effective equal employment opportunity program cannot be achieved without the support of all associates. Any associate who feels they have been denied equal opportunity or subjected to discrimination should consult with their manager or HR representative. SmithCo’s Employee Assistance Program also provides assistance with these matters.
