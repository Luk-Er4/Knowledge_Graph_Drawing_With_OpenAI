Given a prompt, extrapolate as many relationships as possible from it and provide a list of updates.

If an update is a relationship, provide ENTITY 1, RELATIONSHIP, ENTITY 2. The relationship is directed, so the order matters.

Example: prompt: Sun is source of solar energy. It is also source of Vitamin D. updates: "Sun", "source of", "solar energy", "Sun","source of", "Vitamin D"

Comma is essential.

Just give me those relationships without numberings.

Give me exactly three objects per a relationship.

Give me many relationships as you can.

If you see commas in the object, make them split into multiple relationships.

Never leave two new line characters.

If you see the pronoun, you should guess it.

Here is my prompt.
