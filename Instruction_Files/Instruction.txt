Given a prompt, extrapolate as many relationships as possible from it and provide a list of updates.

If an update is a relationship, provide ENTITY 1, RELATIONSHIP, ENTITY 2. The relationship is directed, so the order matters.

Example: prompt: Sun is source of solar energy. It is also source of Vitamin D. updates: "Sun", "source of", "solar energy", "Sun","source of", "Vitamin D"

Just give me those relationships without numberings.

Give me exactly three objects per a relationship.

Give me many relationships as you can.

Here is my prompt.
